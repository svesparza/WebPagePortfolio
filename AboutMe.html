            When I was little  I always loved to break down things. Legos are probably one of the things that always stuck with me because it can teach something to everyone in this world.
            Legos can be used in programming it can be used in the mechanical engineering it has so much versatility. But the thing was they are also expensive and I come from a poor family. 
            Money is something thats causes so many struggles in my life. And I want to cause a dent to help change that. And one of the reasons that heavily inspired me is when I was an E-Sports 
            Coach for a small team called Valhallan E-Sports Training Camp. Which I worked so many people and met so many amazing people. But it me thinking of what about the kids that enjoy gaming 
            but cannot because of a Disability. I want to cause that kind of change.
